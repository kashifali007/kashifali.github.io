<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello and Welcome to my Portfolio.<p> 
<div>My name is Kashif Ali and a dedicated Komodo Notary operator since last year. By profession I'm a software engineer in Test/Automation. My skills & expertise include C, python, Java, Javascript, vbscript, html, APIs(soap/rest), shell programming and shell scripting </div>
<div>I had joined SuperNET technologies in 2016 as Test Engineer and have been testing IGUANA core through out, which also includes Agama wallet testing as well which was an excellent experience for me to play around stunning technologies.
</div>
<div>As a Notary operator, I was elected last year as a notary operator and it was splendid experience for me but a little disappointed because 
i couldn't perform well. Well I've learnt from my mistakes and I'm looking forward to be a Notary operator again!</div>
